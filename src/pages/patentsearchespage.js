Such searches are conducted prior to making an investment in drafting and filing a patent. The knock out searches are preferred by inventors to save costs on assessing the patentability of the invention. Organizations leverage knock out searches to reduce the volume of invention disclosures in the pipline by ensuring high quality. We have in-depth experience in performing knock out searches by identifying prior art references which target the novelty aspect of the invention. The search is conducted using commercial patent databases and is restricted to three major filing jurisdictions, i.e. US, EP, and WIPO. Our report formats are extremely structured, easy to understand, and tailored as per your requirements.</p>

The objective of the search is to identify prior art relevant to the novelty of the invention in patent and non-patent literature.

It requires an applicant to submit a pre-examination report along with the patent application in order to receive the examiner’s final decision within 12 months.

The key objective of the validity and invalidity search is to unearth prior art that was likely missed by the patent examiner during the prosecution stage, which may potentially question the novelty or non-obviousness of the reference. An invalidity/validity search involves conducting a thorough patent and non-patent literature search to identify prior art references predating the earliest filing of the patent.</p>

In order to assess the risk of potential infringement and avoid subsequent litigation, the organization should proactively perform a FTO search to identify any patents that may potentially map to the features of the product or service to be launched.Generally, the FTO search is restricted to a particular jurisdiction, however, it is prudent to search for international applications which can potentially enter the target jurisdictions in order to be absolutely sure of obtaining a patent. An FTO search involves a claim specific search to locate claims that read on the features of the product or service to be launched in the market.</p>

Bio-sequence searches involves finding a specific arrangement of sequences in the patent or non-patent document. Bio-Sequence search helps the inventor to ascertain whether the sequence is novel. Since the novelty of the sequence lies in the unique combination of nucleotides or amino acids, a keyword-based search alone cannot capture the entire data-set including all the relevant results. Even if the desired sequence has a similar name, all patents would not include the name, and thus a number of such results may be missed during the keyword-based search.</p>

Our team of pharmaceutical experts and chemical engineers assist you in determining the novelty and validity of a claim in a chemical structure by conducting searches in subscribed patent databases. We perform in-depth analysis of the structures to identify similar compounds. Depending on the type of the structure and database, structure searching is supplemented by other strategies such as IUPAC/Common name search, CAS number search to overcome the inherent limitations of the database and ensure best quality results.

                      Some of the key tools used for structure searching are Scientific Technical Networks (STN), which is a network of more than 200 databases, Chemspider, etc.</p>
