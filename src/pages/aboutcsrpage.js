                Under our ‘Geo-Effect’ initiative, we have come up with a Tree plantation drive. We have a mission to plant at least 5,000 trees across Delhi-NCR in 2021. For this, our team is engaged with different NGOs to help us achieve our goal.
</p><p class="mt-4 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 ">
                Our employees have also volunteered to help with our mission. Since we all are working from home, we have created some green activities that they can do with their families. We have created these activities in such a way that they can utilize the waste material around them and use them to plant trees.

                Through our tie-up with Children community centers, we have decided to be guardian angels to underprivileged children to celebrate National Give Away Day. Our agenda is to improve our community in a way that benefits all. We plan on taking this opportunity to spread joy by giving something they need. Showing empathy, encouragement, and compassion to someone during the time of need empowers us all.
